# TaskManager

This project was to keep track of my Utilization by recording my input and output hours on a weekly basis in a SQL database.

## To start this project off right. 
<br> 
Please do the following:
<br>
Create a folder called utilization. 
Add the TaskManager.ipynb file into that folder.
<br>

Next create a virtualenv...
<br>
Need Python 3!!! 
<br>
python -m venv py3
<br>
source py3/bin/activate

#### Make sure that you have the requirements.txt file in the current directory. Look for it in the "setup files" folder.
