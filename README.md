# TaskManager

This project was created to keep track of my Utilization time by recording my input and output hours on a weekly basis in a SQL database.

## To start this project off right. 
<br> 
Please do the following:
<br>
<br>
Create a folder called utilization. 
<br>
Add the TaskManager.ipynb file into that folder.
<br>
Next create a virtualenv...
<br>
<b>Need Python 3!!!</b> 
<br>
python -m venv py3
<br>
source py3/bin/activate

#### Make sure that you have the requirements.txt file in the current directory. Look for it in the "setup files" folder.
<br>
Next run the following
<br>
<br>
pip install -r requirements.txt
<br>
<br>
You should be good for now.
