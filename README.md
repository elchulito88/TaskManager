# TaskManager

This project was to keep track of my Utilization by recording my input and output hours on a weekly basis in a SQL database.

## To start this project off right. Please do the following

### Create a folder called utilization. Next add the TaskManager.ipynb file into that folder.

### Next create a virtualenv...

Need Python 3!!!
python -m venv py3
source py3/bin/activate

### Make sure that you have the requirements.txt file in the current directory. Look for it in the "setup files" folder.

### Next run the following

pip install -r requirements.txt
